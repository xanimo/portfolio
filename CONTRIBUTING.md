# Contributing

Please feel free to open an issue when you feel like.

Specially if you feel that there are UI/UX improvements that can be done to the project. 
I was never good with it. 

Don't try to start a Pull Request without opening an issue first. 
It makes it so easy to keep track of a PR. 

In the end, enjoy yourselves and make the world a better place.
